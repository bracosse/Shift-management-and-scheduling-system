This is my MA thesis project.
A shift management system that efficiently handles employee scheduling for a 24/7 operation. It manages employees, roles, holidays, and exceptions, ensuring fair distribution of morning, evening and night shifts while respecting labor laws. The system automatically generates monthly schedules, tracks project-specific and general shifts, and allows updates for holidays or emergency leaves. 
It uses SQLite for data storage and includes features for calculating work hours, managing days off, and maintaining equitable workloads among employees.
The application is designed to be extendable into a web-based interface.
